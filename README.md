# Calculator-app

- This is just a small project I built to help me practice and get better with the fundamentals of HTML, CSS, and vanilla Javascript.

## This is a good project to practice:

- Event listners
- Usage of querySelectors
- If else statments
- Object destructuring
- Basic HTML
- Basic CSS

## To run app 
### Ran using Go Live extension in VSCode.

- git clone git@github.com:Jburdt/calculator-app.git
- Install Live Server from the VSCode extension.
- On the bottom right side of the screen you should see a "Go live" button, click that and it should open a window, and you should see the app running on a local server.
